        <h1>About James Wilson</h1>
        <div class="cuc">
          <p>
            I was born in Cleveland, OH, the eldest of five children. From an
            early age, I learned the value of hard work. I got my first job at
            age 14, a paper route. I did that for three years. During high
            school I also held other jobs including working in a supermarket,
            cutting grass, and even doing a stint at McDonalds. Throughout high
            school I was also very involved with sports, playing on the varsity
            basketball and baseball teams. In my senior year I hit 27 home runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was admitted to the University of Wisconsin where I studied
            finance. I earned excellent grades and was awarded the Dean's List
            recognition every semester during my four years there. It was at
            college that I got interested in financial planning and insurance. I
            took a course on managing risk, and the things I learned in that
            course have never left me. After college I decided to enter the life
            insurance business, which was the best professional decision I've
            ever made.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, I married my college sweetheart, Barbara. Over the next few
            years, we had four children, two boys, and two girls. I'm a very
            lucky dad and husband.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I earned the RICP professional designation. This further
            enhanced my skills in retirement income planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am still active in sports, playing in a senior softball league and
            coaching my kids' basketball and softball teams,
