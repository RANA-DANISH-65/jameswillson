            that in year two the policy earned less than the assumed rate. Let's
            say 5% was credited. The Defined Benefit Life policy management
            system will send an annual report informing the policy owner of two
            options: 1. Raise the premium to the amount required to keep the
            policy of track for the $100,000 income, or, 2. Keep the premium
            unchanged and be on track for a slightly lower income.

              insurance provides a Death Benefit that protects beneficiaries.
              Second, the economics of life insurance- tax-deferred growth and
              tax-free access to cash via policy loans- are distinctly
              advantaged and valuable benefits that can be leveraged to create
              an income at retirement which is income tax-free.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is Defined Benefit Life different than purchasing an ordinary
              cash value life insurance policy?

          <div class="containerB">
            <p>
              What makes Defined Benefit Life different (and exceptionally
              valuable) is the linking of the life insurance policy to an
              administrative service that manages the policy toward the
              objective of providing your desired income at retirement. While
              Defined Benefit Life is not a defined benefit pension, its
              administrative service mimics the economic calculations used in
              defined benefit pension plans. This transforms a life insurance
              policy into a unique retirement security vehicle. â€‹

            <img src="./assets/insur.avif" alt="" />
            <p>
              With Defined Benefit Life, the policyowner identifies a targeted
              annual income to begin at a selected age. Each year, the premium
              required to fund the annual income is calculated and communicated
              to the policyowner. Small adjustments keep you on track for the
              desired income.

              Because of its inherent premium flexibility and options for
              crediting interest, Defined Benefit Life utilizes a type of life
              insurance policy called Indexed Universal Life (IUL).
            </p>
            <p>
              IUL offers the potential for interest crediting linked to one or
              more stock indexes. Depending upon the specific life insurance
              policy, available indices may include the S&P 500, NASDFAQ 100, or
              Russell 2000. Some insurers offer proprietary indices. In many
              cases, policy owners may choose to have more than one index.

          <h4>The Potential for Growth.</h4>
          <h5>And Protection Against Loss.</h5>
          <p>
            IUL offers the potential for interest growth linked to a stock
            index. That said, IUL is not an investment, and it should not be
            compared to investments. Rather, the life insurance policy is a
            tax-advantaged vehicle for saving.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tenB">
          <p>
            Many IUL policies have a "current" or non-guaranteed participation
            rate. In this hypothetical example, the index grows by 6%. But when
            applying the 200% participation rate, the interest credited to the
            policy is 12%. Some IUL policies "cap" the level of interest that
            can be credited in any year.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/tenA.avif" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="tenC">
          <p>
            In this example, the IUL policy has the same 200% participation
            rate. However, for the year in question the index lost 15%. But
            because the IUL policy provided a "floor" of 0%, the policy owner is
            insulated against the 15% index loss. Instead, the policy would
            receive no interest credit for that year. This example illustrates a
            critical advantage of IUL: The potential for growth without the risk
            of loss.

              All life insurance policies have costs and fees built in. Licensed
              insurance agents are required to provide you detailed information

              IUL policies have "participation rates," the percentage of index
              growth that is credited to the policy. For example, a 100%
              participation rate would mean that the policy would be credited
              with 100% of any index gain. At the time a policy is issued, the
              participation rate will be the "current" participation rate then
              applicable. The current participation rate is not guaranteed. Why?
              A main reason is that the participation rate is sensitive to
              interest rates. The insurance company cannot know in advance the
              level of future interest rates. Therefore, the policy will
              guarantee a baseline participation rate. Similarly, the policy
              will stipulate a minimum interest rate. As the years pass, and as
              interest rates move up and down, the insurance company will tend
              to change the participation rate in accordance with interest rate
              movements. Licensed agents must provide an illustration that shows
              the minimum guaranteed results of an IUL policy.
